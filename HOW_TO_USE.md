2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab

2. Find this line:
   ```json
   "title": "💌 My Precious Anjana - My Everything 💌",
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```json
   "title": "💌 TEST - My Precious Anjana - My Everything 💌",
   ```

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Appearing?

1. **Did you save the file?**
   - Make sure you clicked "Save" in your text editor
   - Check the file date/time changed

2. **Did you refresh the browser?**
   - Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R`
   - Or try `Ctrl+Shift+R` for hard refresh

3. **Is the file in the right place?**
   - `messages.txt` must be in same folder as `index.html`
   - Check: `mini-koala/messages.txt` and `mini-koala/index.html`

4. **Check for JSON errors:**
   - Make sure you didn't break the JSON format
   - Every `{` needs a `}`
   - Every field needs commas (except last one)
   - Strings need quotes: `"text"`

5. **Check browser console:**
   - Press `F12` → Console tab
   - Look for errors (red text)
   - Should see: `✅ Messages loaded successfully from messages.txt!`

6. **Try clearing cache:**

   - Clear cached files
   - Refresh page
